## **How to Use This Guide**

This workbook helps you prepare for CELPIP Speaking. It is designed for learners aiming for CLB 5 or CLB 7\.

Each topic gives you two word lists, example sentences, useful connectors, and a real CELPIP‑style speaking task.

Practice routine: choose a topic, read the words, say the examples, then record a 60‑second answer using 2 or 3 new words and at least one connector.

## **Important Notes**

Speak naturally and spontaneously. Do not memorize full answers.

Vocabulary alone does not guarantee your score. CELPIP speaking is evaluated in four areas:

1\) Task Fulfillment: you answer the question fully and clearly.

2\) Coherence and Organization: your ideas are connected and easy to follow.

3\) Vocabulary: your words are accurate, appropriate, and varied.

4\) Listenability: your pace, pronunciation, and grammar are clear.

Want personal feedback on these criteria? Book a free 25‑minute assessment and I will check your speaking and create a plan for CLB 5 or 7+. \[Insert booking link\]
